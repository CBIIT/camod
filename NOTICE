Please see LICENSE file for details.


This project was developed as part of the NCI caBIG initiative.

The cancer models database (caMOD) provides information about animal models for human cancer to the public research community.
* Data Submission: Data in caMOD are extracted from the public scientific literature by curators or they are directly submitted by scientists.
* Search: Users can retrieve information about the making of models, their genetic descriptions, histopathology, images, microarray data, and therapeutic trials in which the models were used, and other information as well.
* System Function Administration: The Admin function provides services for user registration, review of submitted models and database management.

The primary users of this tool are researchers interested in detailed information about animal models of human cancer.

The project was initially developed by SAIC and SAIC-Frederick under funding from the CBIIT office of the National Cancer Institute.

In 2013, as part of the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Open Development Initiative, 
the caMOD source code was migrated to GitHub to allow further development by the broader community.

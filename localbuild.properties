# Local Build Properties #
##########################
# Properties in this file are intended to be bound before those in the
# build.properties file assuming the build.xml file imports this file before
# build.properties. This permits build.properties to be version controlled
# while each development platform may utilize a local version of this file
# to bind locally tailored property values without need of modification in
# the build.properties file. This leverages the first-come-first-served feature
# of Ant script property binding. To utilize the "production" file properties,
# simply remove localbuild.properties from the build repository.
#
# A copy of the properties found in build.properties are included here as
# comments as a convenient reminder of the property names and production value
# used at the time of this file's origin.
# 
# For development, test or debugging, this file may be used for temporary
# property values--removing the necessity for concern about such changes
# getting inadvertently left in build.properties.

/**
 * WebTree is the abstract base class for implementation of a web based GUI tree
 * navigator. This class encapsulates all functionality necessary to build web
 * trees that are processed by the WebTreeMain.jsp.
 * <p>
 * How to implement:
 * <p>
 * Create a subclass extending this class implementing the getTree(Hashtable
 * params) method. This is the only REQUIRED method to implement, others are
 * optional to gain further functionality. You must create a tree structure
 * using the DefaultMutableTreeNode swing component consisting of WebNode
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * Optionally you can implement the getSynonyms(String term) method to add the
 * functionality of a synonym search executed during the tree search. Give the
 * search term entered by the user, a Vector of additional search terms to
 * search the tree for should be returned.
 * <p>
 * Optionally you can implement the getPostSearchMsg() method. This method is
 * called after a search is performed, and should return a string containing
 * information you may feel is useful to communicate to the user. It is
 * displayed at the end of the search results list.
 * <p>
 * How to execute:
 * <p>
 * The WebTreeMain.jsp is the primary jsp that will process the tree for GUI
 * display. It requires one parameters at a minimum. The 'treeClass' parameter
 * which should point to your derived class. The jsp will then invoke the
 * getTree(Hashtable params) you have implemented to retrieve the tree
 * structure. Using the 'treeParams' parameter in the jsp allows you to send
 * your getTree method parameters for your internal use. The 'treeParams'
 * parameter should contain a string of parameters in the format of
 * "key1:value1;key2:value2;key3:value3" etc.. These parameters will be
 * represented in the Hashtable that is passed into the getTree(Hashtable
 * params) method you implement.
 * <p>
